# DataScienceProjects

This repository is an effort to put both project steps and completed projects in one area.

# First Steps <br/>

<br/>
At the beginning of any project, a decision on what is to be studied /or predicted must be made.  Once that decision is made, a formulation of questions the researcher believes will provide the clearest answer is made.  A review of the questions is followed by a collection of data.  This repository will start just after the collection of data using publicly available datasets. <br/>
